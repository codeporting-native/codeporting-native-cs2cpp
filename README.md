# CodePorting.Native Cs2Cpp

CodePorting.Native Cs2Cpp is a porter application that migrates C# project to C++

This repository contains [Example C# projects](https://github.com/codeporting-native/codeporting-native-cs2cpp/tree/master/ExampleProjects) for CodePorting.Native Cs2Cpp to demonstrate [how C# code is ported to C++](https://wiki.codeporting.com/native/cs2cpp/getting-started/). Visit [codeporting.com](https://www.codeporting.com/) to get more details on this software.

[template.porter.config](https://github.com/codeporting-native/codeporting-native-cs2cpp/blob/master/template.porter.config) file is a CodePorting.Native Cs2Cpp configuration file which can be used as a base for compiling a configuration for your own project.

[Qt helpers](https://github.com/codeporting-native/codeporting-native-cs2cpp/tree/master/qt_helpers) project contains the code that allows converting CodePorting.Native Cs2Cpp types into Qt ones and vice versa. Examples are also included.

[Qt Creator debugging helpers](https://github.com/codeporting-native/codeporting-native-cs2cpp/tree/master/qtcreator_debugging_helpers) subdirectory contains [Qt Creator debugging helper file](https://github.com/codeporting-native/codeporting-native-cs2cpp/blob/master/qtcreator_debugging_helpers/asposetypes.py) that allows inspecting contents of CodePorting.Native Cs2Cpp types in Qt Creator's debugger. Example project is also included.
